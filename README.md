# Lens ID Example

This repo demonstrates an integration between Lens and Polygon ID. It's meant to demonstrate how developers can interact with the Lens API to retrieve data about a connected Lens Profile and show them how to issue Verifiable Credentials against the same data.

## Getting Started

This is Next.js app designed to enable anyone to get started with Polygon ID. To begin, you need to follow these steps:
- setup an Issuer Node, (guide here)[https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/issuer/setup-issuer-core/]
- Edit the file `id.js` and enter your Issuer Node URL, API username and password
- Run the application by entering `yarn dev` and navigate to the URL provided
